# Ninja Level 5
1. 
    * Using a `composite literal`:
        * create an array whcih holds 5 values of type int
        * assing values to each index position
    * Range over array and print the values out
    * using format printing
        * print out the type of the array

2. Do same as above but with a slice of 10 values
3. Create the following slices with this slice
    * `x := []int{42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 41}`
        * [42, 43, 44, 45, 46]
        * [47, 48, 49, 50, 41]
        * [44, 45, 46, 47, 48]
        * [43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
4. 
    * Start with this slice
        * `x := []int{42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51}`
    * append 52 to slice
    * in ONE STATEMENT append to the slice 53, 54, 55
    * append to the slice
        * y:= []int{56, 57, 58, 59, 60}
    * Print out slice
5. 
    * Start with this slice
        * `x := []int{42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51}`
    * Finish with
        * `[42, 43, 44, 48, 49, 50, 51]`
6. Make a slice for all the states
7. Create a slice of slice of sting. Store the following data in the multi-dimensional slice.
    * "James", "Bond", "Shaken, not stirred"
    * "Miss", "Moneypenny", "Martini"
8. Create map of bond characters and a list of their favorite things. Print out all of their values and index position in the slice.
9. Add a records to the map before loop
10. Delete a record from the map then loop.
